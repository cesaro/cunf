=====================================
Cunf: An Unfolder for Contextual Nets
=====================================

Cunf is a set of research tools to carrying out unfolding-based
`formal verification`_ of `Petri nets`_ extended with `read arcs`_, also called
contextual nets, or c-nets.  The package specifically contains the tools:

- ``cunf``: constructs the unfolding of a c-net;
- ``cna``: performs reachability and deadlock analysis using unfoldings
  constructed by cunf;
- Scripts such as ``pep2dot`` or ``grml2pep`` to do format conversion between
  various Petri net formats, unfolding formats, etc.
- ``ptnet``: a small Python module (see `<tools/ptnet/>`__) suitable to
  programmatically generate and manage Petri net models.

Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

Runnig ``cna`` will require that the ``minisat`` SAT solver be present in the
``$PATH`` (`download here <http://minisat.se/>`__).
Compiling the source code will just require ``make`` and a C/C++11-compatible
compiler. Building the documentation requires ``latex``.

From Precompiled Binaries (include examples)
--------------------------------------------

Please check the `latest release`_ to find a ``.tar.gz`` file with precompiled
binaries (currently only available for Linux x86_64).

1. Download the ``.tar.gz`` file and uncompress it.
2. All binaries are in the ``bin/``, you can directly invoke them from there.
3. You may move the ``cunf`` binary elsewhere in your system, but do not move
   the ``cna`` binary as it locates a necessary Python package using a relative
   path from the ``bin`` folder.

From Source Code
----------------

Please note that development takes place in the ``master`` branch of this
repository. If you want a stable version of the tool you should download and
compile the sources of the `latest release`_ available.

1. Download and uncompress the source code (in this case for Cunf v1.6.1)::

    wget https://github.com/cesaro/cunf/archive/v1.6.1.zip
    unzip cunf-1.6.1.zip
    cd cunf-1.6.1

2. Compile the source code::

    make all
    make dist

   This will put all binaries and libraries into the ``dist/`` folder, from
   where you may copy them to suitable locations in your machine following the
   instructions above for precompiled binaries.

3. In particular, make available to Python the module in::

    dist/lib/ptnet

   by copying it to any folder pointed by your installation-dependent default
   module search path, or any folder pointed by the environment variable
   ``PYTHONPATH``.  The tool ``cna`` and other Python scripts won't work without
   this step.

Documentation
=============

Documentation (including a tutorial) is available in the Cunf user's manual
available in the `latest release`_ of the tool.

Algorithms
----------

Cunf implements the contextual net unfolding algorithm proposed by Baldan et al.
in [BCKS08]_.  The algorithms and data structures actually implemented have been
partially described in [RSB11]_, [BBCKRS12]_.  Cunf can only unfold 1-safe
c-nets (i.e., no reachable marking puts more than one token on every place), and
for the time being the tool will blindly assume the input is 1-safe.

Cna, whose name stands for *Contextual Net Analyzer*, checks for place
coverability or deadlock-freedom of a c-net by examining its unfolding.  The
tool reduces these problems to the satisfiability of a propositional formula
that it generates out of the unfolding, and uses
`Minisat <http://minisat.se/>`__
as a back-end to solve the formula.  The algorithms used by Cna has been
described in [RS12]_.
