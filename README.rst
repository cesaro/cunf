===================
The Cunf Tool v.1.6
===================

The Cunf Tool is actually a set of tools for carrying out unfolding-based
verification of Petri nets extended with read arcs, also called contextual
nets, or c-nets.  The package specifically contains the tools:

 - cunf: constructs the unfolding of a c-net;
 - cna: performs reachability and deadlock analysis using unfoldings
   constructed by cunf;
 - Scripts such as pep2dot or grml2pep to do format conversion between
   various Petri net formats, unfolding formats, etc.

Cunf is written in C, the sources are in src/ and /include. Cna is
written in python, and depends on the "ptnet" module; both are located
in the tools/ folder.

Cna requires the Minisat solver to be in the $PATH.  For your
convenience, the source code of Minisat v.2.2.0 is present in the
minisat/ folder, and the main Makefile will compile it for you.

Quick Installation
------------------

Full details about the installation are given in section 3 of the manual:

https://cunf.googlecode.com/files/user-manual-v1.6.pdf

The installation puts all binaries and libraries into the "dist/"
folder, from where you may copy them to suitable locations in your
machine.

Type the following commands::

  make all
  make dist

After that, make available to Python the module

dist/lib/ptnet,

by copying it to any folder pointed by your installation-dependent
default module search path, or any folder pointed by the environment
variable PYTHONPATH.  Cna and other Python scripts won't work without this
step.
