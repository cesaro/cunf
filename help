Usage: cunf [OPTION]... NET [SPECIFICATION]

where NET is a path to an .ll_net input file.  Allowed OPTIONS are:

 --cutoff={mcm,parikh,erv,mole,N}
      Sets the algorithm used for computing cutoff events:
       * mcm     McMillan's algorithm
       * parikh  Parikh vector strategy FIXME
       * erv     Esparza-Romer-Vogler's total order
       * mole    The modification of ERV implemented in the unfolder Mole
       * N       A non-negative number N will instruct Cunf to cut off
                 events of depth N; with N=0 the cutoff algorthm is
                 disabled and the unfolder may never stop

 --save-unf=FILE
      Saves a copy of the unfolding to FILE.

 -v, --verb=N
      Increments the verbosity level by the optional parameter N, a number
      between 0 and 3, with 3 being the most verbose level).  If N is not
      provided it is assumed to be 1.  Multiple occurrences allowed.
