# Asynchronous boolean circuit consisting in a square grid of NxN AND gates.
#
# The inputs of every gate are the outputs of the its north and west gates.
# The initial state of all signals is low except for the signals at the
# top and left boundaries of the grid, which are high.  Only the rising edges
# of signals are simulated -- no transition is generated for the falling edges,
# since no falling edges will happen.
#
# The output is a contextual net.  Referred in the TCS paper
