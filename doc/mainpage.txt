= Overview =

The Cunf Tool is actually a set of tools for carrying out unfolding-based
verification of Petri nets extended with read arcs, also called contextual nets,
or c-nets.  The package specifically contains the tools:

 * cunf: constructs the unfolding of a c-net;
 * cna: performs reachability and deadlock analysis using unfoldings constructed by cunf;
 * Scripts such as pep2dot or grml2pep to do format conversion between various Petri net formats, unfolding formats, etc.

Cunf is written in C and comprises around 4000 lines of code. Cna is
written in Python, and depends on the "ptnet" module; both are located
in the `tools/` folder of the repository.  Cna requires the
[http://minisat.se/ Minisat solver] to be in the `$PATH`.
For your convenience, a copy of Minisat is distributed both in the bundles
of precompiled binaries and with the sources.

= Petri Nets and Unfoldings =

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net Petri nets] are a modelling language for concurrent systems.
The reader unfamiliar to the topic could perhaps start with (Mur89).

Contextual nets are Petri nets where, in addition to the ordinary
_arrows_ between places and transitions, one may find
_read arcs_.
These allow transitions to verify that
tokens exist in a place before firing, but don't consume them
when firing.
Transitions can then be thought of reading a
_context_ required to fire, hence the name.

The unfolding of a c-net is another well-defined c-net of
acyclic structure that fully represents the _behaviour_ (reachable
markings) of the first.
A c-net unfolding is at most as big as the reachablity graph of the
c-net.
Because unfoldings represent behaviour by partial orders rathen than by
interleavings,
for highly concurrent c-nets, unfoldings are often much
(exponentially) smaller, which makes for natural interest in them
for the verification of concurrent systems.

= Verification Algorithms =

The Cunf Tool implements the c-net unfolding procedure proposed by Baldan et
al. in (BCKS08).  The algorithms and data structures actually
implemented have been partially described in (RSB11,BBCKRS12).
Cunf can only unfold 1-safe c-nets (i.e., no reachable marking puts more
than one token on every place), and for the
time being the tool will blindly assume the input is 1-safe.

Cna, whose name stands for _Contextual Net Analyzer_,
checks for place coverability or deadlock-freedom of a c-net by examining
its unfolding.  The tool reduces these problems to the satisfiability of a
propositional formula that it generates out of the unfolding, and uses
[http://minisat.se/ Minisat]
as a back-end to solve the formula.
The algorithms used by Cna has been described in (RS12).

= File Formats =

Cunf accepts as input a c-net represented in a modified version of the PEP's
low level (ll_net) format --- see section 6 of the
[http://cunf.googlecode.com/files/user-manual-v1.6.pdf user manual]
for details on the modification.
The output is a file in CUF format (also described there)
storing the contextual unfolding of the net.
Some scripts are provided to generate PDF or JPEG images out of c-nets and
unfoldings, see section 7 of the
[http://cunf.googlecode.com/files/user-manual-v1.6.pdf manual].
