# Overview #

The Cunf Tool is a set of programs for carrying out unfolding-based
[verification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification)
of [Petri nets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net)
extended with read arcs, also called contextual nets, or c-nets.
The package specifically contains the tools:

  * cunf: constructs the unfolding of a c-net;
  * cna: performs reachability and deadlock analysis using unfoldings constructed by cunf;
  * Scripts such as pep2dot or grml2pep to do format conversion between various Petri net formats, unfolding formats, etc.

Cunf is written in C. Cna is
written in Python, and depends on the
[ptnet](http://code.google.com/p/cunf/source/browse/tools/ptnet) module;
Cna requires the
[Minisat solver](http://minisat.se/) to be in the `$PATH`.
For your convenience, a copy of Minisat is distributed both in the bundles
of precompiled binaries and with the sources.

# Petri Nets and Unfoldings #

[Petri nets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net) are a modelling language for concurrent systems.
The reader unfamiliar to the topic could perhaps start with (Mur89).

Contextual nets are Petri nets where, in addition to the ordinary
_arrows_ between places and transitions, one may find
_read arcs_.
These allow transitions to verify that
tokens exist in a place before firing, but don't consume them
when firing.
Transitions can then be thought of reading a
_context_ required to fire, hence the name.

The unfolding of a c-net is another well-defined c-net of
acyclic structure that fully represents the _behaviour_ (reachable
markings) of the first.
A c-net unfolding is at most as big as the reachablity graph of the
c-net.
Because unfoldings represent behaviour by partial orders rathen than by
interleavings,
for highly concurrent c-nets, unfoldings are often much
(exponentially) smaller, which makes for natural interest in them
for the verification of concurrent systems.

# Algorithms #

The Cunf Tool implements the c-net unfolding procedure proposed by Baldan et
al. in (BCKS08).  The algorithms and data structures actually
implemented have been partially described in (RSB11,BBCKRS12).
Cunf can only unfold 1-safe c-nets (i.e., no reachable marking puts more
than one token on every place), and for the
time being the tool will blindly assume the input is 1-safe.

Cna, whose name stands for _Contextual Net Analyzer_,
checks for place coverability or deadlock-freedom of a c-net by examining
its unfolding.  The tool reduces these problems to the satisfiability of a
propositional formula that it generates out of the unfolding, and uses
[Minisat](http://minisat.se/)
as a back-end to solve the formula.
The algorithms used by Cna has been described in (RS12).
